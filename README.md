# Rootless Wordpress container image for Kubernetes & Openshift

Supporting the OpenShift Community with Rootless Wordpress Image.

The open-source ecosystem thrives on choice and transparency. With Bitnami silently discontinuing their rootless Wordpress image on Docker Hub, many OpenShift users were left without a trusted, non-root alternative.

We provide a fully maintained rootless Wordpress container image, ready for OpenShift and other non-root environments, helping developers continue building secure and compliant containerized applications.
